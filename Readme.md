Orion is a framework for creating a config-based REST API server, meaning the client can create a full-fledged API server by only defining a single configuration file. The framework is built on top of [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express). The server application that the framework creates will support CRUD, file upload, authentication, and error handling.

See [the framework's documentation](https://ctjong.github.io/orion) for more details.
